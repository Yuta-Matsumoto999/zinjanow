## Overview

I wanted to create something for learning, so I created this application in flutter. It is said that there are about three times as many Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples in Japan as there are convenience stores. This application uses Google Map API to search for shrines within a certain distance from your current location. The searched shrines can be registered as favorites, and if you visit the shrine, you can record your visit (check-in) to the shrine. <br />
